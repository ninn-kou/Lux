# [1528. Shuffle String](https://leetcode.com/problems/shuffle-string/)

## 1. Description

Given a string `s` and an integer array `indices` of the **same length**.

The string `s` will be shuffled such that the character at the $i^{\text{th}}$ position moves to `indices[i]` in the shuffled string.

Return the *shuffled string*.

**Example 1:**

![](1528_example.jpg)

```
Input: s = "codeleet", indices = [4,5,6,7,0,2,1,3]
Output: "leetcode"
Explanation: As shown, "codeleet" becomes "leetcode" after shuffling.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: s = "abc", indices = [0,1,2]
Output: "abc"
Explanation: After shuffling, each character remains in its position.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: s = "aiohn", indices = [3,1,4,2,0]
Output: "nihao"
```

**Example 4:**

```
Input: s = "aaiougrt", indices = [4,0,2,6,7,3,1,5]
Output: "arigatou"
```

**Example 5:**

```
Input: s = "art", indices = [1,0,2]
Output: "rat"
```

**Constraints:**

- `s.length == indices.length == n`
- `1 <= n <= 100`
- `s` contains only lower-case English letters.
- `0 <= indices[i] < n`
- All values of `indices` are unique (i.e. `indices` is a permutation of the integers from `0` to `n - 1`).

## 2. Solutions

### Solution 1: `Language: C` Malloc a New String and Copying

Malloc a string called `new` which has the same size as the given one, and we could copy each char from `s` to `new` by the correct order. The size should be `(indicesSize + 1)`, Because the string `s` should be `['c','o','d','e','l','e','e','t','\0']`.

***Be aware that `new[indices[i]] = s[i];` is tried to put each char in `s` to the correct place; but `new[i] = s[indices[i]];` is tried to sort the original string by the `indices` order. They are totally different, and the first one could only return the excepted result.***

// If the function free() needs to be called?
char *restoreString(char *s, int *indices, int indicesSize) {
    char *new = malloc((indicesSize + 1) * sizeof(char));
    for (int i = 0; i < indicesSize; i++) {
        new[indices[i]] = s[i];
    }
    // And string should end with a '\0'.
    new[indicesSize] = '\0';
    return new;
}
```
