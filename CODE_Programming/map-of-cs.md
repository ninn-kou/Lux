- Data Structure
- Formal Methods
- ......

### Alan Turing -> Turing Machine

```
... 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 1 1 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 ... // Infinitely Long Type
					|----^----|				// Head --> Read & Move
				111010(B) = 58(Decimal)
											// State Register
											// 1. Replace/Erase
											// 2. L/F/N
											// 3. Keep/Change to another state
```

### Hardware

Input, Output and Calculation(Lambda Calculus).

- RAM
- CPU
- GPU
- SSD
- Power
- Mouse & Keyboard
- Sound & Monitor

### Computational Complexity

Which problems can you solve with a computer?

```
How problems Scale?

1. Amount of memory
2. Number of steps
```

#### P versus NP problem

If the solution to a problem is easy to **check** for correctness, must the problem be easy to solve?

- P: Solving the task that runs in polynominal time;
- NP: Nondeterministic Polynmomial Time.
- NP-Complete

Eg. for P =? NP: 53308290611 % 224737 = 0;  
Eg. for NPC: Subset sum problem --> O(2^n);

#### Analysis of Algorithms

- Bubbble Sort -> O(n^2)

- Merge Sort -> O(n\*log(n))

### Information Theory

Relating to Coding Theory.

Eg. [458. Poor Pigs](https://leetcode.com/problems/poor-pigs/description/)

> There are 1000 buckets, one and only one of them is poisonous, while the rest are filled with water. They all look identical. If a pig drinks the poison it will die within 15 minutes. What is the minimum amount of pigs you need to figure out which bucket is poisonous within one hour?
>
>Answer this question, and write an algorithm for the general case.

## Computer Engineering

How **to** slove the problem by computers?

### Scheduling

```
		Steam		Videos		Browser		Music		// Processes
	[________________________________________________]
							|
						Scheduler --> CPU(1,2,3,4....)	// Multiprocessing
```

### Computer Architecture

Central Processing Unit.

```
	Input --> CPU --> Output
			   |
			Memory Unit
```

GPU --> Multiprocessors  
FPGA --> Logic Block, Interconnection, Input/Output, Switch Box, Connect Block

### Software and Programming Languages

```
	Silicon --> BIOS --> Operating System --> Applications --> Browser --> Web Apps

			Assembly		C 					SQL			PERL		JavaScript
							C++					PHP			Python
									C#			Swift
									Java
```

#### Compliers
