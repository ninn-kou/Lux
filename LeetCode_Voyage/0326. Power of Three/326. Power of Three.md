# [326. Power of Three](https://leetcode.com/problems/power-of-three/)

## 1. Description

Given an integer `n`, return `true` if it is a power of three. Otherwise, return `false`.

An integer `n` is a power of three, if there exists an integer `x` such that $n = 3^x$.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: n = 27
Output: true
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: n = 0
Output: false
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: n = 9
Output: true
```

**Example 4:**

```
Input: n = 45
Output: false
```

**Constraints:**

- $-2^{31} \leq n \leq 2^{31} - 1$

## 2. Solutions

### Solution 1: `Language: C` Loop Iteration

By continually dividing `n` by three if the remainder is not equal to $0$, we would found the less factor of the integer `n`. If the result equals $1$, the number must be a multiple of 3; otherwise, it is not.
