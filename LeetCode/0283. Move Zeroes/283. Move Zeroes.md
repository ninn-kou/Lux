# [283. Move Zeroes](https://leetcode.com/problems/move-zeroes/)

## 1. Description

Given an array `nums`, write a function to move all `0`'s to the end of it while maintaining the relative order of the non-zero elements.

**Example:**

```
Input: [0,1,0,3,12]
Output: [1,3,12,0,0]
```

**Note:**

- You must do this **in-place** without making a copy of the array.
- Minimize the total number of operations.

## 2. Solutions

### Solution 1: `Language: C` Two Pointers

> This approach works the same way as above, i.e. , first fulfills one requirement and then another. The catch? It does it in a clever way. The above problem can also be stated in alternate way, " Bring all the non 0 elements to the front of array keeping their relative order same".
>
> This is a 2 pointer approach. The fast pointer which is denoted by variable "cur" does the job of processing new elements. If the newly found element is not a 0, we record it just after the last found non-0 element. The position of last found non-0 element is denoted by the slow pointer "lastNonZeroFoundAt" variable. As we keep finding new non-0 elements, we just overwrite them at the "lastNonZeroFoundAt + 1" 'th index. This overwrite will not result in any loss of data because we already processed what was there(if it were non-0,it already is now written at it's corresponding index,or if it were 0 it will be handled later in time).
>
> After the "cur" index reaches the end of array, we now know that all the non-0 elements have been moved to beginning of array in their original order. Now comes the time to fulfil other requirement, "Move all 0's to the end". We now simply need to fill all the indexes after the "lastNonZeroFoundAt" index with 0.

Move all non-zero integers at the start by order, then put 0 for "swapping". Refer to the below diagram.

    int slow = 0;
    // Copy all non-zero integer in front of all zeros.
    for (int fast = 0; fast < numsSize; fast++) {
        if (nums[fast] != 0) {
            nums[slow] = nums[fast];
            slow++;
        }
    }
    // Put zeros at the end.
    while (slow < numsSize) {
        nums[slow] = 0;
        slow++;
    }
}
